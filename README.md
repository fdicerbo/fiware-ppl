fiware-ppl
==========

This is PPL, an implementation of FI-WARE Data Handling Generic Enabler, please check for more information: http://wiki.fi-ware.eu/FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Security.Data_Handling_Generic_Enabler


PREREQUISITES

Create database "ppl", "ppl-dc" and "ppl-3p".
The default configuration assumes that database system runs on localhost on
port 3306 (e.g. default configuration for MySQL).


BUILD

Project uses Maven as a build tool.
The parent project is "ppl-engine".
Simply run:

> mvn package

in the "ppl-engine" project directory to build the full project.


RUNNING

1. Reset database: run "database-reset/reset_db" script.
2. Final build produces a WAR file:
	- "ppl-rest/target/ppl-rest.war"
	
	Drop this file into your Tomcat "webapps" directory and lunch the server.
3. The REST backend will be loaded and available.

Using the Accountability Feature

The log analyser makes it possible to check the compliance of the logs generated by the PPL engine. Data handling operation appearing in the logs are checked against the sticky policies that specify agreements between data controller and data subject about the admissible handling of personally identifiable information.

The code for the feature, which is implemented in Haskell, can be obtained from the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/inria-db/accountability-ppl

Download the code, for instance by clicking on the Download ZIP button on the right-hand side of the page.

Next, download and install the Haskell Platform from here [1], or alternatively only the GHC Haskell compiler from [2].

The feature can then be compiled as follows from a command prompt, in the directory of its source code:

ghc loganalyser.hs

Compliance checks can be performed directly, without preliminary parameterization. It is sufficient to run the executable as follows:

./loganalyser piiId

Where piiId is an integer (the identifying number of the PII for which to perform the check).

The feature concatenates and analyses all log files in the working folder. Both logs from the event handler (*.event.log) and from the MySQL database (*.mysql.log) are processed. The log analyser tool displays the list of data handling events in a standardised format, as well as the sticky policy, and the conclusion of the compliance check.
